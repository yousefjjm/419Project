# NLP and Machine Learning Techniques in Python

## Introduction
This project explores various natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques using Python. It focuses on implementing and comparing different NLP models and algorithms using the `sklearn` and other libraries, such as `Panda`, `PyTorch`, etc. Also, there is an attempt at an RNN network at the bottom.

## Installation
you can install Juypter Lab into your system, or you can simply use Google Collab (with Collab you do not have to manually install the libraries)
