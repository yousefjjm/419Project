# NLP and Machine Learning Techniques in Python

## Introduction
This project explores various natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques using Python. It focuses on implementing and comparing different NLP models and algorithms using the `sklearn` and other libraries, such as `Panda`, `PyTorch`, etc. Also, there is an attempt at an RNN network at the bottom.

## Installation
you can install Juypter Lab into your system, or you can simply use Google Collab (with Collab you do not have to manually install the libraries)

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes several Python libraries for natural language processing and machine learning tasks. The key libraries include:

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for working with human language data (`nltk.corpus`, `nltk.tokenize`).
- **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: A machine learning library used in various components like `ensemble`, `linear_model`, `metrics`, `model_selection`, `naive_bayes`, `neighbors`, `svm`.
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: For string searching and manipulation.
- **Time**: For time access and conversions.
- **PyTorch (Torch)**: A machine learning library used for deep learning applications (`torchtext.vocab` for NLP).


## Abstract
Efficient data preparation is crucial in machine learning applications, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). This project focuses on comprehensive data curation through lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, and stop-word elimination to enhance the quality of reviews. The subsequent analysis delves into the implementation of Bag-of-Words, N-Grams, RNN, and TF-IDF as feature extraction methods, with a detailed code overview. The comparison reveals that TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words emerge as the most effective techniques based on accuracy and time. The study concludes with the remaining work outlined, emphasizing code implementation, validation, testing, result comparison, and the final report and presentation.

## Sample Results
I will be showcasing a sample result of TF-IDF:
